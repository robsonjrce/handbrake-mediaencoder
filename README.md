Recommended quality settings

Recommended settings for x264 and x265 encoders:

    RF 18-22 for 480p/576p Standard Definition1
    RF 19-23 for 720p High Definition2
    RF 20-24 for 1080p Full High Definition3
    RF 22-28 for 2160p 4K Ultra High Definition4

Raising quality minus 1-2 RF may produce better results when encoding animated Sources (anime, cartoons). Lower quality settings may be used to produce smaller files. Drastically lower settings may show significant loss of detail.

Using higher than recommended quality settings can lead to extremely large files that may not be compatible with your devices. When in doubt, stick to the recommended range or use the default setting for the Preset you selected.
